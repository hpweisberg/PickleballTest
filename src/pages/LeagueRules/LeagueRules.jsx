                  <li className='bullet'>The League takes considerable care, time, and input from team captains to ensure that the schedule is accurate and accommodating to every team in the league each season. In addition, as a League, it is expected that players on each team understand the dedication and time requirement needed to complete matches each week. While we want everyone to play in the League, to ensure equity and fair play, players should understand that the schedule matters and teams should play their match each week and not reschedule each weekâ€™s matches. In an effort to ensure equity and fair play and team captain feedback, the League has detailed the rules around forfeiting a match.

                  <li className='bullet'>A team that is unable to play a match when it was scheduled or rescheduled will lose by forfeit (see Match Guidelines and Reschedule Guidelines).
